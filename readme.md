# TODO
- Good name
- Slides add actual feedback
- Microphone
- [Object Avoidance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO1CaPIjt8M)
- [GPS Guided Robot](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Build-a-GPS-Guided-Robot/)
- [Google Maps Navigation](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/convert-google-navigation-signal-into-a-arduino-control-signal/389816)
- [Use for xml route](https://kurviger.de/)

## If everything works by Monday:
- Buy Bluetooth or look into using WIFI from car 
- Google Maps API -> Give coordinates to move to for robot
- Gyro for direction
- Look into what the camera module can do
- Could implement stop button for robot if red lights won't work

# VIDEO IDEAS
- Montage of building and realizing mistakes -> Drill onto mat -> New dog
- Put Coke can on back (strap it on)
- GPS coordinates to halal truck
- Go home -> Go to Levine
- Take me with leash
- Adress issue of red lights
    - Ideas: OpenCV with Android phone, use camera on Arduino, but can't handle that much data
    - Future: Use Raspberry Pi
