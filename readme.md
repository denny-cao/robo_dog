# TODO
- Android App
    - Phone on Roselle -> Use phone's GPS coords
    - Generate XML file to parse "turning points" of pathing
        - Unnecessary; App Inventor has built in [Navigator](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/components/maps.html#Navigation)
    - Use microphone to take in input for locations
    - Bearing from phone as well -> Gyro not needed
- Set up Bluetooth
- Test sensitivity constant
    - The actual longitude/latitude data is EXTREMELY percise
- Improve object avoidance

## If everything works by Monday:
- Buy Bluetooth or look into using WIFI from car 
- Google Maps API -> Give coordinates to move to for robot
- Gyro for direction
- Look into what the camera module can do
- Could implement stop button for robot if red lights won't work

# VIDEO IDEAS
- Montage of building and realizing mistakes -> Drill onto mat -> New dog
- Put Coke can on back (strap it on)
- GPS coordinates to halal truck
- Go home -> Go to Levine
- Take me with leash
- Adress issue of red lights
    - Ideas: OpenCV with Android phone, use camera on Arduino, but can't handle that much data
    - Future: Use Raspberry Pi
